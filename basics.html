    <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some HTML</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>This would be element number one</li>
      <li>This would be number two, my firend</li>
      <li>We hate the bank, is this running away?</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Inline elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase </p>
    <p><strong>Other times you need to </strong> empasize the important word of a frace</p>
    <p><em><strong>And this is like too much</em>isn-t it?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>What difference does it make the other way about?</strong></em>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Internetting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <p>Regards,<br/>
    The Authors</p>
